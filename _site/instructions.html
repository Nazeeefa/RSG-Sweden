      <h3 id="install-jekyll-and-its-dependencies">Install Jekyll and its dependencies:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Get a new-ish version of ruby. You can use the first part of this guide to install rbenv, which allows to run a newer version of ruby side-by-side with the older version that came with Linux. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-16-04 Just follow their explanation until you hit the “Working with Gems” section. &lt;/br&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that, you can install “bundler” and “jekyll” via the gem system. ‘gem install bundler jekyll’ &lt;/br&gt;
For more info on this, check out: http://bundler.io/ and https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ &lt;/br&gt;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-a-new-project">Create a new project:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Every Jekyll project consists of something called a Gemfile, where you list all the versions of Jekyll and any themes/plugins you’d like to use. Via the ‘bundle install’ command, everything will be set up for you. &lt;/br&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a theme: &lt;/br&gt;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>there’s a number of different ways to get it working: either copy their Github directory, install it via the Gemfile OR install it via the Gemfile but specifically aimed at Github pages. <strong>So, keep note of what the documentation you’re reading is describing exactly, to avoid confusion!</strong></p>

<h3 id="tweak-the-contents-to-your-liking-br">Tweak the contents to your liking: &lt;/br&gt;</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Everything in Jekyll is based on a number of .html lay-outs for different “types” of webpages (main landing page, blog posts, archives, etc.), some liquid templates that allow for easier referencing between files and templates, CSS templates, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing you really need to do yourself is write the page contents in markdown files and configure the main settings in the _config file (unless you want to tweak the lay-out further of course, like adding things to the footer of your site).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minimal-mistakes documentation is a superb resource for this, and it should carry over to other templates, for the most part. Definitely check out the _config explanation, or take a look at the one we’re using. A very important aspect is the url and baseurl entry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can look at a local copy of your site via: bundle exec jekyll serve or build it using bundle exec jekyll build. This’ll create a _site directory containing the plain HTML files you’ll need to host your site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another unique property of the minimal mistakes theme is that, if you ever want to tweak the default lay-out or CSS, you’ll need to copy the settings from your system-wide theme config folder, to your current working directory. You can find their locations by running bundle show minimal-mistakes (as described here: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/overriding-theme-defaults/).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hosting-on-the-rsg-domain-br">Hosting on the RSG domain: &lt;/br&gt;</h3>

<p>Use FTP/SSH access to our own subdomain, and just copy the contents of the _site directory into the /home/rsgsweden/rsg-sweden.iscbsc.org/directory</p>
