# RSG-Sweden

This is a repository for the RSG-Sweden's website development. </br>

The website is available at www.rsg-sweden.iscbsc.org </br>

Inspiration can be taken from: </br>

http://www.cbiovikings.org </br>
http://www.rsg-belgium.iscbsc.org </br>
http://slaveryfootprint.org/ (replace arms/hands with DNA strings?) </br>

We could utilise either Jekyll (www.jekyllrb.com) or Twitter Bootstrap for theme/designing. </br>

To decide what Jekyll theme would suit the website, please visit http://jekyllthemes.org/

## Content for Website:

Please use Github's "issue" feature to discuss ideas.

- About Page (brief description with photos of core committee members, and names + institutions of sub-committee members)
- Events Page
- Contact information on bottom of every page with links to social media, website, and Slack Channel (we will use icons rather than lengthy text).
